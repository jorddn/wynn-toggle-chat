# Wynn Toggle Chat

Wynn Toggle Chat is a simple mod that adds commands to switch between and toggle different channels so you don't have to type `/p` or `/g` before every message on WynnCraft.

## Commands

**To toggle a channel:**

```
/chat <channel>
Valid channels: all, party, guild
```

**To send a message in all chat:**
> Without toggling between channels first.
> <br>
> **Note**: `/p` and `/g` can be used as usual while in other channels.

```
/achat <message>
/ac <message>
```
